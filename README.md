### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Finding measurements of people with random things!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Using basic division and random function in Python to select item. 

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used

### Project Documentation
For Software:
This project is a unique web application built with Python and the Flask framework. It transforms a user's height and weight, entered in standard metric units like centimeters and kilograms, into a variety of unconventional and humorous measurements. Users interact with a simple form to input their data and select from a list of predefined, quirky units‚Äîsuch as measuring height by the number of ants or weight by the number of elephant droppings. The Flask backend dynamically processes these inputs, uses internal conversion factors to perform the calculations, and then displays the results on the webpage, offering a fun and creative spin on a typical unit converter.
